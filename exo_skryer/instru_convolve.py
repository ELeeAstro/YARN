    """Convolve high-resolution spectrum into observational bins (JIT core).

    This function performs the actual convolution calculation using pre-computed
    padded arrays from the bandpass registry. It uses Simpson's rule integration to
    compute the weighted average of the spectrum within each bin.

    Parameters
    ----------
    spec : `~jax.numpy.ndarray`, shape (nwl_hi,)
        High-resolution spectrum evaluated on the master wavelength grid.
    wl_pad : `~jax.numpy.ndarray`, shape (nbin, max_len)
        Padded wavelength samples for each bin. Each row contains the wavelength
        points where the response function is sampled, padded to max_len.
    w_pad : `~jax.numpy.ndarray`, shape (nbin, max_len)
        Padded response weights/throughputs for each bin. Each row contains the
        instrument response at the corresponding wavelengths, padded.
    idx_pad : `~jax.numpy.ndarray`, shape (nbin, max_len)
        Padded indices into the high-resolution spectrum array. Maps each
        wavelength sample to its position in `spec`.
    norms : `~jax.numpy.ndarray`, shape (nbin,)
        Normalization factors for each bin, typically the integrated throughput:
        ∫ w(λ) dλ over the bin's wavelength range.
    valid_lens : `~jax.numpy.ndarray`, shape (nbin,)
        Number of valid (non-padded) points for each bin.

    Returns
    -------
    binned_spectrum : `~jax.numpy.ndarray`, shape (nbin,)
        Convolved spectrum in observational bins. Each element represents:
        bin_i = ∫ F(λ) w(λ) dλ / ∫ w(λ) dλ

    Notes
    -----
    The convolution is computed as:
    1. Extract spectrum values at sampled wavelengths using `idx_pad`
    2. Multiply by response weights: F(λ) × w(λ)
    3. Integrate using Simpson's rule with vmap over bins
    4. Normalize by integrated throughput

    The simpson_padded function handles the padded arrays correctly by using
    valid_lens to determine which points are real vs padded.

    The normalization denominator is clamped to 1e-99 to prevent division by zero.

def apply_response_functions(spectrum: jnp.ndarray) -> jnp.ndarray:
    """Apply instrument response functions to convolve spectrum onto observational bins.

    This function takes a high-resolution model spectrum and convolves it with
    pre-loaded instrument response functions to produce a binned spectrum matching
    the observational wavelength grid. The response functions (boxcar, Gaussian,
    filter throughput curves, etc.) are retrieved from the bandpass registry.

    Parameters
    ----------
    spectrum : `~jax.numpy.ndarray`, shape (nwl_hi,)
        High-resolution model spectrum evaluated on the master wavelength grid.
        This should be the output from a radiative transfer calculation.

    Returns
    -------
    binned_spectrum : `~jax.numpy.ndarray`, shape (nbin,)
        Convolved spectrum in observational bins. Each element represents the
        flux integrated over the corresponding instrument response:
        F_bin[i] = ∫ F(λ) R_i(λ) dλ / ∫ R_i(λ) dλ

        If no bins are registered (nbin=0), returns an empty array with the
        same dtype as `spectrum`.

    Notes
    -----
    The bandpass registry must be loaded before calling this function using
    `load_bandpass_registry()` from the registry_bandpass module. The registry
    caches pre-computed wavelength samples, response weights, and normalization
    factors for efficient convolution.

    This function is designed to work inside JIT-compiled forward models. The
    bandpass data is fetched once and then passed to the JIT-compiled convolution
    kernel.
